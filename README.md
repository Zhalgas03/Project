# Introduction
Problem Description:
With the increasing adoption of IoT devices, the amount of data generated has grown exponentially. Efficient systems are necessary for managing and analyzing this big data to extract valuable insights and make informed decisions.

Project Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop an integrated system that uses an MQTT server and Python to receive, process, and store data from IoT sensors in various databases. The databases include MySQL for structured data, MongoDB for unstructured data, and Neo4j for graph-based data storage. The system will process and store the data based on the topic of the MQTT messages.
